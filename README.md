<h2>About Me</h2>

Hi, I'm KB.

I have had a fascination with networking communications from a young age, and how that intersects with cybersecurity and privacy. I always wondered why my computer at home could only access solitaire and my friends PC could load MSN, connect and talk to people. It was like magic. Simultaneously I very quickly learned about the risks that this technology brings...

With the cloud takeover and increasing use of AI, we approach a new frontier as our daily lives become enveloped by these systems, for better or for worse. Having well-built, secure networks and systems is now more crucial than ever. I want to contribute and assist in this process whilst protecting the human element.

I have a background in enterprise desktop support. This past summer I achieved a level 3 in networking & cybersecurity, and I have been accepted onto the AWS re/Start course which I am currently completing. I am now looking for opportunities to progress and professionally enter the world of networking/security/privacy.

Outside of this endeavour I am deeply invested in music - producing, drumming, dancing - and I really enjoy sports and martial arts.
