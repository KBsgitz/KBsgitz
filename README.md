<h2>About Me</h2>

Hi, I'm Keon.

I have had a fascination with networking communications from a young age. I always wondered why my computer at home could only access solitaire and my friends PC could load MSN, connect and talk to people. It was like magic. Being a military brat, I have an appreciation for logic and order. This combination lead to the prospect of becoming a network engineer very interesting to me. 

With the cloud takeover and increasing use of AI, the tech world is becoming even more interesting as we approach a new frontier. Having well-built, secure networks and systems is now more crucial than ever and I want to contribute in this way.

I have just completed a year long networking and cybersecurity course this summer, to pivot into this specialism. I am now looking for opportunities to progress, whether that is a level 4+ or an entry position in employment.

Outside of networking I am deeply invested in music - producing, drumming, dancing - and I really enjoy sports and martial arts.
